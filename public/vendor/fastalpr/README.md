# FastALPR assets

The FastALPR ONNX models are not committed to the repository because they are
large binary files. Place the following files in this directory when hosting the
app:

- `yolo-v9-t-384-license-plates-end2end.onnx`
- `global_mobile_vit_v2_ocr.onnx`

You can download them from your preferred storage location and either commit
them to your deployment branch or host them on a CDN. See the project README
for automated download options and configuration details.
