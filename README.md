# PassingPlates

Plate Scanner is an open-source project that experiments with on-device license plate detection and statistics. The goal is to discover how often you encounter the same vehicles without sending data to the cloud.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `npm` installed (see the PRD for platform versions).
3. Run `npm install` to fetch dependencies.

## Usage

The application is under active development. Once the React Native app is available, you can run:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios # or run-android
```

## Next Steps

To start contributing to the React Native rewrite, see `DEV_PLAN.md` for a list
of incremental tasks and their associated tests. The short version:

1. Bootstrap the project with TypeScript.
2. Integrate camera and database libraries.
3. Add Jest and Detox tests as features land.
